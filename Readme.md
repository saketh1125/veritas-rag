# Veritas-RAG

Veritas-RAG is a citation-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed
to answer questions from documents with **strict grounding and page-level citations**.
The system avoids hallucinations by retrieving relevant document chunks and
forcing the language model to cite exact sources for every factual claim.
